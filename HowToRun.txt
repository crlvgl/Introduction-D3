How to run

The entire project:


Method 1: Using Node.js
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
    - open a terminal or command prompt and type `node -v` to check if Node.js is installed.
    - If not installed, download and install it from https://nodejs.org/.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    - Use the command `cd path/to/your/project` to change directories.
    - You need to be in the directory where `package.json`, `index.html`, and `Notebook/` are located.
3. Install the required dependencies.
    - Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
4. Start the server.
    - Run the command `npm start` to start the server.
    - The server should be configured to run on `http://localhost:5500` or a similar port. npm will tell you the exact URL.
5. Open your web browser.
    - Navigate to the URL provided by npm (e.g., `http://localhost:5500`).
6. You should see the project running in your browser.
    - if not, manually open `127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` in your browser.
    - make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.
7. To stop the server, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.
    - If prompted, confirm that you want to stop the server by typing `y` or `j` (depending on your language settings).


Method 2: Using Live Server Extension in Visual Studio Code
    - This method requires Visual Studio Code. If you want to use a different IDE, you can still follow the Node.js method.
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Ensure you have the Live Server extension installed.
    - Open the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
    - Search for "Live Server" and install it if you haven't already.
        - Extension ID: ritwickdey.LiveServer
        - Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer (Extension ID preferred)
3. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
    - Use `File > Open Folder...` and select the project directory.
    - Ensure the folder contains `package.json`, `index.html`, and the `Notebook/` directory.
4. Start the Live Server.
    - In the bottom right corner of Visual Studio Code, click on the "Go Live" button.
        - This will start a local server and open your default web browser.
        - On default, it will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5500` or `http://localhost:5500`.
5. Open your web browser.
    - If it doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`.
6. You should see the project running in your browser.
    - make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.
7. To stop the server, click on the "Port: 5500" button in the bottom right corner of Visual Studio Code


Method 3: Using Python's HTTP Server
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
    - Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` or `python3 --version` to check if Python is installed.
    - If not installed, download and install it from https://www.python.org/ or the Microsoft Store.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    - Use the command `cd path/to/your/project` to change directories.
    - You need to be in the directory where `index.html` and `Notebook/` are located.
3. Start the HTTP server.
    - Run the command `python -m http.server 5500` or `python3 -m http.server 5500`.
4. Open your web browser.
    - Navigate to `http://localhost:5500` or `http://127.0.0.1:5500`.
5. You should see the project running in your browser.
    - If not, manually open `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` in your browser.
    - Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings.
6. To stop the server, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.
